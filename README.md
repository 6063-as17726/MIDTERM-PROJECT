I chose the book - "Where's Waldo" which is an interactive book, where the goal is to find the character Waldo. 
I want to include the concept of chaos in my program, inspired by the chaos on the book cover. 
I want to make an interactive piece where there are random, abstract forms all over the canvas, and the goal is to find a specific type of form, that would look like Waldo. Or create a canvas where the user can create their own abstract forms all over. The forms could also move with passing time. 
I would want to experiment with mouse click functions, and also functions (My idea is to create different functions with different abstract forms and call them randomely)
I guess I could relate this idea to the concept of interactivity, which we read about in "The Art of Interactive Design" by Chris Crawford, where I would want to address form and function.
