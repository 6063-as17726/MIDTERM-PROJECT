I chose the book - "Where's Waldo" which is an interactive book, where the goal is to find the character Waldo. 
I want to include the concept of chaos in my program, inspired by the chaos on the book cover. 
I want to make an interactive piece where there are random, abstract forms all over the canvas, and the goal is to find a specific type of form, that would look like Waldo. Or create a canvas where the user can create their own abstract forms all over. The forms could also move with passing time. 
I would want to experiment with mouse click functions, and also functions (My idea is to create different functions with different abstract forms and call them randomely). Maybe I can also use arrays to store the different shape data points?
I guess I could relate this idea to the concept of interactivity, which we read about in "The Art of Interactive Design" by Chris Crawford, where I would want to address form and function.

Week 2 update - 
For Week 2, I worked on the logic of the code. I laid out the code from start to finish. However, some of my logics are not completed and the overall code is not running yet. But, i aim to work on that this week. Some sketches for the logic:

As per this sketch, the x and y coordinates of Waldo would be pre-determined. Waldo would be drawn seperately than the other characters.

This sketch shows the different character functions being put in an array. Subsequently, a nested loop is run to draw the functions at random, in random positions.

This is an updated version of the last sketch, showing the randomized loop, such that the x position of each character is completely random, but the y position would be within a certain range.

Lastly, this sketch showcases the "planned chaos" using a value called rowheight, after which Waldo would be detected based on if the click was within the area of Waldo. 

Week 3 update - 
For Week 3, the last week, I worked on refining the logic. For this, I started by commenting out the entire code, and taking one section at a time. For each section, I went into the details of the logic and refined it. Finally, the code ran, and all that was left to do was further refine the visuals and add descriptive text. 
The final code is an interactive piece inspired by the book, "Where's Waldo". There are characters all over the screen and the goal is to find the character "Waldo". When Waldo is identified and clicked, a pop up shows up on the screen indicating the game is over. The viewer can also save or refresh the screen.
