I chose the book - "Where's Waldo" which is an interactive book, where the goal is to find the character Waldo. 
I want to include the concept of chaos in my program, inspired by the chaos on the book cover. 
I want to make an interactive piece where there are random, abstract forms all over the canvas, and the goal is to find a specific type of form, that would look like Waldo. Or create a canvas where the user can create their own abstract forms all over. The forms could also move with passing time. 
I would want to experiment with mouse click functions, and also functions (My idea is to create different functions with different abstract forms and call them randomely). Maybe I can also use arrays to store the different shape data points?
I guess I could relate this idea to the concept of interactivity, which we read about in "The Art of Interactive Design" by Chris Crawford, where I would want to address form and function. 

Concept revision - 
After getting started with the code, I realized that it is extremely difficult for me to create the "game-like" functioning of the code. 
So I decided to rethink the click functions to be interactive in populating different characters on the screen using classes and arrays and click functions. 
A fun second step could also be to add other interactive functions to change colors, shapes, etc.
