I chose the book - "Where's Waldo" which is an interactive book, where the goal is to find the character Waldo. 
I want to include the concept of chaos in my program, inspired by the chaos on the book cover. 
I want to make an interactive piece where there are random, abstract forms all over the canvas, and the goal is to find a specific type of form, that would look like Waldo. Or create a canvas where the user can create their own abstract forms all over. The forms could also move with passing time. 
I would want to experiment with mouse click functions, and also functions (My idea is to create different functions with different abstract forms and call them randomely). Maybe I can also use arrays to store the different shape data points?
I guess I could relate this idea to the concept of interactivity, which we read about in "The Art of Interactive Design" by Chris Crawford, where I would want to address form and function.

Week 2 update - 
For Week 2, I worked on the logic of the code. I laid out the code from start to finish. However, some of my logics are not completed and the overall code is not running yet. But, i aim to work on that this week. Some sketches for the logic:

As per this sketch, the x and y coordinates of Waldo would be pre-determined. Waldo would be drawn seperately than the other characters.

This sketch shows the different character functions being put in an array. Subsequently, a nested loop is run to draw the functions at random, in random positions.

This is an updated version of the last sketch, showing the randomized loop, such that the x position of each character is completely random, but the y position would be within a certain range.

Lastly, this sketch showcases the "planned chaos" using a value called rowheight, after which Waldo would be detected based on if the click was within the area of Waldo.
